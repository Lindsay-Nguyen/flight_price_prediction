✈️ Flight Price Analysis & Prediction
End-to-end project using PostgreSQL + Python for data wrangling, EDA, and machine learning.

📂 Dataset
Kaggle: Flight Price Prediction
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction

🛠 Workflow
SQL (PostgreSQL): Cleaned and joined tables, computed avg. prices by airline/class/stops.
EDA (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib): Price distribution, avg. by airline, stops vs price.
ML (scikit-learn): Linear Regression for price prediction.

📊 Results
R² = 0.90 → explains 90% of price variance
MAE = 4,905 | RMSE = 7,123

Top drivers:
Class (Economy/Business) → ~92%
Duration → ~6%
Others (airline, stops, dep. time) → <2%
